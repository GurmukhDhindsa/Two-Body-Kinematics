# Two-Body-Inverse-Kinematics
This MATLAB program will help individual to calculate Energy w.r.t to angle for both light and heavy outgoing particles in elastic nuclear reaction.
All you have to change the values of masses of reaction particles in the first four lines. Ta is the energy with which our beam is colliding with target. 
Eb is the energy of the light particle. This will be calculated as function of theta with which is it is coming out with respect to the x axis.
Similarly EB will give the energy of the heavy particle.
Phi is the angle defined for heavy particle and this phi will be calculated using momentum of both heavy and light particle.
In the end of program a text will be generated and we can save value of any parameter just by changing paramater name.
Using text file we can also plot by taking one paramter along x axis and another parametr along y axis.you will understand once you will through this code.
